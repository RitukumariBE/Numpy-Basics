# Student Marks Analysis using NumPy

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student marks data using **NumPy**.  
The objective is to perform subject-wise and student-wise analysis to understand overall performance, identify top and weak performers, and derive meaningful insights from numerical data.

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly data analysis project using only NumPy, without relying on Pandas or visualization libraries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create and understand a structured numerical dataset using NumPy
- Perform subject-wise performance analysis
- Analyze individual student performance
- Rank students based on overall marks
- Practice analytical thinking and interpretation of results

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
- The dataset is a **2D NumPy array**
- **Rows represent students**
- **Columns represent subjects**
- Total students: **10**
- Total subjects: **5**
- Marks range from **0 to 100**
- The dataset is generated programmatically using NumPy

---

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- NumPy arrays
- Array shape and dimensions
- Indexing and slicing
- Aggregation functions (sum, mean, min, max)
- Axis-based operations
- Sorting and ranking using indices
- Analytical observations and conclusions

---

## 📈 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Dataset Creation
- Generated a numerical dataset representing student marks
- Clearly defined the meaning of rows and columns
- Verified data shape and structure

---

### 2️⃣ Understanding the Dataset
- Accessed individual student records (row-wise)
- Accessed subject-wise marks (column-wise)
- Extracted subsets of data using slicing
- Explained each extraction in terms of real-world meaning

---

### 3️⃣ Subject-wise Analysis
- Calculated average marks for each subject
- Identified highest and lowest marks per subject
- Analyzed subject difficulty and overall balance in performance
- Derived observations based on statistical comparison

---

### 4️⃣ Student-wise Analysis
- Calculated total marks per student
- Computed average marks per student
- Identified strong, average, and weak performers
- Analyzed overall class performance distribution

---

### 5️⃣ Student Ranking
- Ranked students based on total marks
- Identified top-performing students
- Identified bottom-performing students
- Analyzed performance gaps between ranks

---

## 🔍 Key Insights (So Far)
- Certain subjects show comparatively lower average scores, indicating higher difficulty
- Student performance varies, with a few clear top performers
- Ranking helps clearly distinguish strong and weak students
- NumPy alone is sufficient for meaningful numerical data analysis

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Pass–Fail classification based on performance criteria
- Outlier detection
- Performance normalization
- Extension of this project using Pandas and visualization libraries
